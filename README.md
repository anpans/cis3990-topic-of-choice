# CIS3990 Topic of Choice Assignment

I will be following a tutorial on WebGL.
I am interested in learning about this technology because, even though I'm unsure if it'll be useful in my group's final project, it was the only one out of the suggested technologies that I had no previous experience with.

The tutorial I will be following can be found at: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial
